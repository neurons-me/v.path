# v.path
Install using npm.

```js
npm i v.path
```
**What is v.path?** 
A storage system that manages and tracks memory path usage on a network. It applies memory management methods similar to those used in individual computers to the network as a whole.
The encryption and decryption of information are based on the specific path and credentials it is serving.

Here are some key points about the v path and memory allocations:

- **Memory Path Usage:** **v.path** keeps track of the usage and allocation of memory paths on the network. It provides a centralized system for managing and organizing memory resources across different nodes.
- **Memory Management Methods:** **v.path** applies memory management techniques, such as allocation, deallocation, and garbage collection, to optimize the utilization of memory paths within the network. This helps ensure efficient resource allocation and prevents memory leaks or fragmentation.
- **Encryption and Decryption:** **v.path** is responsible for securing the data stored within memory paths by performing encryption and decryption operations. It ensures that sensitive information remains protected and accessible only to authorized users with the appropriate credentials.
- **Path and Credential-based Access:** **v.path** enforces access control by validating the path and credentials provided by users or systems trying to access specific memory resources. It ensures that only authorized entities can read or modify the data stored in those paths.

Overall, **v.path** acts as a secure and centralized memory management system for the network, providing efficient resource allocation, encryption, and access control mechanisms to protect and manage the network's data.
