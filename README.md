# v.path
**v.path** is a storage system within the **neurons.me** ecosystem, designed to manage and track memory usage across a network. It embodies a comprehensive approach to memory management, akin to strategies employed in individual computer systems but extended to network-wide applications.

<!--v.path kind of like c://path.-->

- **Robust Encryption and Decryption:** v.path ensures the security of data stored within memory paths through rigorous encryption and decryption processes, safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring access only to those with the right credentials.
- **Path and Credential-based Security:** It enforces stringent access control, validating paths and credentials for users or systems attempting to access memory resources, thereby maintaining data integrity and confidentiality across the network.

## Installation
To integrate v.path into your project, install it using npm:
```bash
npm i v.path
```

## Quick Start Example:
```js
import vpath from 'v.path';

// Establish a database connection pool
const dbPool = vpath.createPool({
  host: 'your-hostname',
  port: 5432,
  user: 'your-username',
  password: 'your-password',
  database: 'your-database'
});

// Engage TheVault for advanced data management
const vault = new vpath.TheVault();
console.log(`Directory size: ${vault.getFormattedSize()}`);
```
